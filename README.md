Welcome to my repository where I'm channeling my inner Stirling while wrestling with Neural Networks! Even with a math degree, I sometimes wonder if my brain is just a poorly optimized neural net... :(
</div>

## 🤔 What's Actually Happening?
```math
∇(My_Sanity) = λ(Neural_Networks) + ε
where ε = coffee_intake
```

## 🎯 Current Mission
- [ ] Teaching my neural network that overfitting isn't about gym workouts
- [x] Convincing myself that Hessian matrices aren't mythical creatures
- [ ] Explaining to my GPU why it's getting so hot (it's not cryptocurrency mining, I promise!)
- [x] Converting caffeine into research papers

<summary>🧮 Mathematical State Log</summary>

- Morning: "Let's derive some elegant proofs!"
- Afternoon: "Is this a tensor or my tangled headphones?"
- Evening: "Maybe the real gradients were the friends we made along the way"
- Night: "Dear diary, today I dreamt in higher dimensions..."

## 📝 Daily Research Log
1. Proved that my coffee consumption follows a Gaussian distribution
2. Discovered that my cat understands topology better than me (she's a master of continuous deformation)
3. Realized neural networks are just very ambitious matrix multiplication

<i>In a world of deep learning, be a deep thinker (but not too deep, we don't want to hit a local minimum)</i>

*Warning: Side effects include speaking in mathematical notation, seeing matrices everywhere, and accidentally optimizing your grocery shopping with gradient descent* 🧮

## 🪦 Neural Network Graveyard
Here lies:
- ReLU (Died from negative inputs)
- Sigmoid (Vanished gradually)
- My First Model (Accuracy: -42%)
```python
# Last words:
if loss == float('inf'):
    print("Mr. GPU, I don't feel so good...")
```
